# 1176 Compressor Fix Test

## What was fixed:
1. **Fixed threshold**: The 1176 now has a fixed threshold at -24dB (authentic behavior - very sensitive like real hardware)
2. **Full input gain**: Input knob now applies full gain to drive signal into compression
3. **Proper detection**: Detection happens on the amplified input signal

## Test with -18dB signal:
- Signal at -18dB
- Input gain at maximum (+40dB)
- Result: -18dB + 40dB = +22dB hitting the -24dB threshold
- **Expected: 46dB over threshold = HEAVY gain reduction**

## Even at moderate input settings:
- Signal at -18dB
- Input gain at 0dB (center position)
- Result: -18dB hitting the -24dB threshold
- **Expected: Already 6dB of gain reduction at 4:1 ratio**

## How to verify:
1. Send a -18dB test tone
2. Turn input gain to maximum (+40dB)
3. You should now see gain reduction on the meter
4. Adjust output gain to compensate

## Authentic 1176 behavior:
- More input = more compression (not threshold adjustment)
- Fixed threshold around -10dB
- Input knob drives signal harder into compression
- Ratio controls how much reduction happens above threshold
