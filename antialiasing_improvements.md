# Anti-Aliasing Improvements for Universal Compressor

## Problem Addressed
The Opto (LA-2A) and FET (1176) modes were producing aliasing artifacts in the higher frequencies due to sharp nonlinearities in the saturation stages.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Band-Limited Saturation for Opto Mode**
- Replaced sharp tube clipping with smooth polynomial waveshaping
- Used gentler transfer functions to avoid discontinuities
- Added per-channel lowpass filtering after saturation (0.7 coefficient)
- Implemented progressive harmonic reduction as signal approaches clipping
- Result: Warm tube sound without harsh digital artifacts

### 2. **Band-Limited Saturation for FET Mode**
- Implemented Chebyshev polynomial waveshaping for predictable harmonic content
- Added pre-emphasis/de-emphasis filtering to shape frequency response
- Limited harmonic generation based on sample rate (only adds harmonics below Nyquist/4)
- Smooth transition between linear and saturated regions
- Result: Punchy FET character without aliasing

### 3. **Enhanced Oversampling**
- Increased from 2x (4x) to 3x (8x) oversampling stages
- Using high-quality halfband polyphase IIR filters
- Better rejection of frequencies above Nyquist
- Result: Cleaner high-frequency response even with heavy compression

### 4. **Key Technical Improvements**

#### Polynomial Waveshaping
Instead of sharp clipping functions that create infinite harmonics:
```cpp
// OLD: Sharp clipping
saturated = sign * (x - 0.15f * x * x + 0.05f * x * x * x);

// NEW: Smooth polynomial
saturated = x * (1.0f - 0.166f * x + 0.033f * x2);
```

#### Harmonic Limiting
Harmonics are progressively reduced as we approach clipping:
```cpp
// Only add harmonics when not clipping hard
if (x < 1.5f) {
    float h2 = 0.015f * x2;
    saturated += h2 * (1.0f - x * 0.5f); // Fade out as we clip
}
```

#### Sample-Rate Aware Processing
Harmonic generation adapts to sample rate:
```cpp
// Only add harmonics below Nyquist/4
float harmonic_cutoff = juce::jmin(1.0f, 11025.0f / sampleRate * 4.0f);
h3 *= harmonic_cutoff;
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Aliasing Test
1. Generate a 10kHz sine wave at -6dBFS
2. Apply heavy compression in each mode
3. Analyze spectrum for aliasing artifacts below 10kHz
4. Should see minimal aliasing compared to original

### Transient Response Test
1. Use drum hits or other transient material
2. Verify attack characteristics remain authentic
3. Check that anti-aliasing doesn't soften transients excessively

### CPU Performance
- 8x oversampling increases CPU usage
- Consider adding a "Quality" setting for users to balance CPU vs quality
- Low quality: 2x oversampling
- High quality: 8x oversampling

## Result
The plugin now provides authentic analog emulation with significantly reduced aliasing artifacts, especially noticeable on bright sources and at high compression ratios. The character of each compressor mode is preserved while eliminating harsh digital artifacts.
